            <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
                lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.</p>
            <p>By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found
                lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating
                systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to
                PLCs and embedded systems.</p>
            <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie
                between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the
                kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one
                of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the
                majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.</p>
            <p>C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for
                Standardization (ISO).</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Uses_of_C">
            <header>Uses of C</header>
            <p>C is widely used for systems programming in implementing operating systems and embedded system
                applications, because C code, when written for portability, can be used for most purposes, yet when
                needed, system-specific code can be used to access specific hardware addresses and to perform type
                punning to match externally imposed interface requirements, with a low run-time demand on system
                resources.</p>
            <p>C can be used for website programming using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) as a "gateway" for
                information between the Web application, the server, and the browser.</p>
            <p>C is often chosen over interpreted languages because of its speed, stability, and near-universal
                availability. A consequence of C's wide availability and efficiency is that compilers, libraries and
                interpreters of other programming languages are often implemented in C.</p>
            <p>For example, the reference implementations of Python, Perl, and PHP are written in C.</p>
            <p>C enables programmers to create efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures, because the
                layer of abstraction from hardware is thin, and its overhead is low, an important criterion for
                computationally intensive programs. For example, the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, the GNU
                Scientific Library, Mathematica, and MATLAB are completely or partially written in C.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Here’s the simplest program we can create in C:</p>
            <pre class="code_block"><code>
                
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main( int argc, char** argv) {
      printf(“Hello World!”);
      return 0;
    }
       
            </code></pre>
            <p>This small program just prints “Hello World!” in the screen</p>
            <p>Now let’s analyze it, line by line:</p>
            <p><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> - This line is a preprocessor directive. The preprocessor directives are “commands” evaluated by preprocessor, before compiling the source. In this case, it indicates that the file stdio.h must be included to the program. “stdio.h” is part of C standard library, and regards I/O operations.</p>
            <p><code>int main( int argc, char** argv) {</code> - This is a function. Every C function require parameters in input, and have a return value in output. In this case it is the main function, it is where the program start. All the code inside the curly brackets will be executed.</p>
            <p><code>printf(Hello World!”); </code> - This is the command that allows you to print text on the screen. Printf is a function of standard library. It receives in input the string you want to print, and it will print it on the screen. In this example it has just been used to print a single string, but it can be used also with other data types.</p>
            <p><code>return 0;</code> - The return is a statement that must be present in every non-void function. It indicates that a specific value must be returned by the function. In this case is zero, because this value is commonly used to indicate that no errors have occurred.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
            <header>Comments</header>
            <p>Comments are a way in which you can add text that will not be executed. Comments are used to add informations in your code such as license informations, author, date, and mainly to make the code more understandable.</p>
            <p>In C Language there are two types of comments</p>
            <ul>

            <p>A variable is a storage area, usable in your program, referenced by a mnemonic name. A variable name must start with a letter (in can't start with numbers, but it can contain numbers in any other position)</p>

            <p>In this program, 5 is assigned to variable

                <code>c</code>
                ) will be passed as 2nd parameter.
            </p>

            <header>Arrays</header>
            <p>Often you need to store a lot of data of the same type, like the name of 30 students, or a list of 400 numbers. Giving a name to each variable is not practical. So, in this case you can use arrays. An array is a list of variables of the same type, with the same name. each cell of the array will be referenced by using an offset.</p>

            <p>This will print out 
                <code>b is greater than a.</code>
